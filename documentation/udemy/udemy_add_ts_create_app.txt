you hve to have nodejs and npm installed in the computer
> node -v
> npm i create-react-app



Normally a react project is created by executing :
    > npx create-react-app [name]
typescript
    > npx create-react-app [name] --typescript

After that go to the folder created
    > npm i typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react @types/react-router-dom

If the App.js is still alive, Change the App.js to App.tsx only if it is necessary and execute:
    > npm start
